		<h1>The Odin Project</h1>
		<p>Some time ago I decided to check out the <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/home">Odin Project</a> - a free online web development course. </p>
		
		<!--
		<p>I have done a fair amount of web development in the past, mainly back-end programming using Java and Oracle/MySQL systems, but it's been a good 10+ years since I touched on anything similar. </p>
		
		
		<p>As expected, things have changed a lot.  Therefore, I decided to follow the Odin project
		path in order to refresh my knowledge and gain new skills along the way.</p>
		-->

		<p> This page is part of the Odin course - using Javascript to solve some simple 
		<a href="https://projecteuler.net/"> Project Euler</a> problems. </p>

		<p> Rather than making a very simple text page, I looked around for free templates that would give it a style and allow me to play a bit more with the front-end.
		I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/3155/"> this one</a> which looked good enough foundation for what I wanted. </p>  
		<p> <a href="http://www.oswd.org">Open Source Web Design</a> is a great site which I highly recommend for nice simple designs.  It's also a good resource for studying applied HTML/CSS in 'practice'.
		</p> 
		<p> This page is overly complicated for its purpose.  It could be done with a simpler, cleaner layout.  But please remember the intention here is to play around with menus, logos, colours etc., and add a bit of unnecessary text to test things out ;-) </p>
